## CVE-2025-32433
 Erlang/OTP is a set of libraries for the Erlang programming language. Prior to versions OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20, a SSH server may allow an attacker to perform unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE). By exploiting a flaw in SSH protocol message handling, a malicious actor could gain unauthorized access to affected systems and execute arbitrary commands without valid credentials. This issue is patched in versions OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20. A temporary workaround involves disabling the SSH server or to prevent access via firewall rules.

## CVE-2024-42327
 A non-admin user account on the Zabbix frontend with the default User role, or with any other role that gives API access can exploit this vulnerability. An SQLi exists in the CUser class in the addRelatedObjects function, this function is being called from the CUser.get function which is available for every user who has API access.

## CVE-2024-39943
 rejetto HFS (aka HTTP File Server) 3 before 0.52.10 on Linux, UNIX, and macOS allows OS command execution by remote authenticated users (if they have Upload permissions). This occurs because a shell is used to execute df (i.e., with execSync instead of spawnSync in child_process in Node.js).

## CVE-2024-31317
 In multiple functions of ZygoteProcess.java, there is a possible way to achieve code execution as any app via WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS due to unsafe deserialization. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.

## CVE-2024-8425
 The WooCommerce Ultimate Gift Card plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation in the 'mwb_wgm_preview_mail' and 'mwb_wgm_woocommerce_add_cart_item_data' functions in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

## CVE-2023-38408
 The PKCS#11 feature in ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 9.3p2 has an insufficiently trustworthy search path, leading to remote code execution if an agent is forwarded to an attacker-controlled system. (Code in /usr/lib is not necessarily safe for loading into ssh-agent.) NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-10009.

## CVE-2021-44026

## CVE-2021-41773
 A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.

## CVE-2020-35730
 An XSS issue was discovered in Roundcube Webmail before 1.2.13, 1.3.x before 1.3.16, and 1.4.x before 1.4.10. The attacker can send a plain text e-mail message, with JavaScript in a link reference element that is mishandled by linkref_addindex in rcube_string_replacer.php.

## CVE-2019-2215
 A use-after-free in binder.c allows an elevation of privilege from an application to the Linux Kernel. No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability, however exploitation does require either the installation of a malicious local application or a separate vulnerability in a network facing application.Product: AndroidAndroid ID: A-141720095
