## CVE-2025-62168
 Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. In Squid versions prior to 7.2, a failure to redact HTTP authentication credentials in error handling allows information disclosure. The vulnerability allows a script to bypass browser security protections and learn the credentials a trusted client uses to authenticate. This potentially allows a remote client to identify security tokens or credentials used internally by a web application using Squid for backend load balancing. These attacks do not require Squid to be configured with HTTP authentication. The vulnerability is fixed in version 7.2. As a workaround, disable debug information in administrator mailto links generated by Squid by configuring squid.conf with email_err_data off.

## CVE-2025-57870
 A SQL Injection vulnerability exists in Esri ArcGIS Server versions 11.3, 11.4 and 11.5 on Windows, Linux and Kubernetes. This vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands via a specific ArcGIS Feature Service operation. Successful exploitation can potentially result in unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data from the underlying Enterprise Geodatabase.

## CVE-2025-54782
 Nest is a framework for building scalable Node.js server-side applications. In versions 0.2.0 and below, a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability was discovered in the @nestjs/devtools-integration package. When enabled, the package exposes a local development HTTP server with an API endpoint that uses an unsafe JavaScript sandbox (safe-eval-like implementation). Due to improper sandboxing and missing cross-origin protections, any malicious website visited by a developer can execute arbitrary code on their local machine. The package adds HTTP endpoints to a locally running NestJS development server. One of these endpoints, /inspector/graph/interact, accepts JSON input containing a code field and executes the provided code in a Node.js vm.runInNewContext sandbox. This is fixed in version 0.2.1.

## CVE-2025-49002
 DataEase is an open source business intelligence and data visualization tool. Versions prior to version 2.10.10 have a flaw in the patch for CVE-2025-32966 that allow the patch to be bypassed through case insensitivity because INIT and RUNSCRIPT are prohibited. The vulnerability has been fixed in v2.10.10. No known workarounds are available.

## CVE-2025-29927
 Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Starting in version 1.11.4 and prior to versions 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3, it is possible to bypass authorization checks within a Next.js application, if the authorization check occurs in middleware. If patching to a safe version is infeasible, it is recommend that you prevent external user requests which contain the x-middleware-subrequest header from reaching your Next.js application. This vulnerability is fixed in 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3.

## CVE-2025-23048
Configurations are affected when mod_ssl is configured for multiple virtual hosts, with each restricted to a different set of trusted client certificates (for example with a different SSLCACertificateFile/Path setting). In such a case, a client trusted to access one virtual host may be able to access another virtual host, if SSLStrictSNIVHostCheck is not enabled in either virtual host.

## CVE-2025-6758
 The Real Spaces - WordPress Properties Directory Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via the 'imic_agent_register' function in all versions up to, and including, 3.6. This is due to a lack of restriction in the registration role. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to arbitrarily choose their role, including the Administrator role, during user registration.

## CVE-2025-6079
 The School Management System for Wordpress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the homework.php file in all versions up to, and including, 93.2.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Student-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

## CVE-2024-31317
 In multiple functions of ZygoteProcess.java, there is a possible way to achieve code execution as any app via WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS due to unsafe deserialization. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.

## CVE-2024-7387
 A flaw was found in openshift/builder. This vulnerability allows command injection via path traversal, where a malicious user can execute arbitrary commands on the OpenShift node running the builder container. When using the “Docker” strategy, executable files inside the privileged build container can be overridden using the `spec.source.secrets.secret.destinationDir` attribute of the `BuildConfig` definition. An attacker running code in a privileged container could escalate their permissions on the node running the container.

## CVE-2024-3094
Through a series of complex obfuscations, the liblzma build process extracts a prebuilt object file from a disguised test file existing in the source code, which is then used to modify specific functions in the liblzma code. This results in a modified liblzma library that can be used by any software linked against this library, intercepting and modifying the data interaction with this library.

## CVE-2023-2745
 WordPress Core is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in versions up to, and including, 6.2, via the ‘wp_lang’ parameter. This allows unauthenticated attackers to access and load arbitrary translation files. In cases where an attacker is able to upload a crafted translation file onto the site, such as via an upload form, this could be also used to perform a Cross-Site Scripting attack.

## CVE-2021-3493
 The overlayfs implementation in the linux kernel did not properly validate with respect to user namespaces the setting of file capabilities on files in an underlying file system. Due to the combination of unprivileged user namespaces along with a patch carried in the Ubuntu kernel to allow unprivileged overlay mounts, an attacker could use this to gain elevated privileges.
