## CVE-2025-32395
 Vite is a frontend tooling framework for javascript. Prior to 6.2.6, 6.1.5, 6.0.15, 5.4.18, and 4.5.13, the contents of arbitrary files can be returned to the browser if the dev server is running on Node or Bun. HTTP 1.1 spec (RFC 9112) does not allow # in request-target. Although an attacker can send such a request. For those requests with an invalid request-line (it includes request-target), the spec recommends to reject them with 400 or 301. The same can be said for HTTP 2. On Node and Bun, those requests are not rejected internally and is passed to the user land. For those requests, the value of http.IncomingMessage.url contains #. Vite assumed req.url won't contain # when checking server.fs.deny, allowing those kinds of requests to bypass the check. Only apps explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using --host or server.host config option) and running the Vite dev server on runtimes that are not Deno (e.g. Node, Bun) are affected. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.2.6, 6.1.5, 6.0.15, 5.4.18, and 4.5.13.

## CVE-2025-31125
 Vite is a frontend tooling framework for javascript. Vite exposes content of non-allowed files using ?inline&import or ?raw?import. Only apps explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using --host or server.host config option) are affected. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.2.4, 6.1.3, 6.0.13, 5.4.16, and 4.5.11.

## CVE-2025-29927
 Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Starting in version 1.11.4 and prior to versions 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3, it is possible to bypass authorization checks within a Next.js application, if the authorization check occurs in middleware. If patching to a safe version is infeasible, it is recommend that you prevent external user requests which contain the x-middleware-subrequest header from reaching your Next.js application. This vulnerability is fixed in 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3.

## CVE-2023-45878
 GibbonEdu Gibbon version 25.0.1 and before allows Arbitrary File Write because rubrics_visualise_saveAjax.phps does not require authentication. The endpoint accepts the img, path, and gibbonPersonID parameters. The img parameter is expected to be a base64 encoded image. If the path parameter is set, the defined path is used as the destination folder, concatenated with the absolute path of the installation directory. The content of the img parameter is base64 decoded and written to the defined file path. This allows creation of PHP files that permit Remote Code Execution (unauthenticated).
