## CVE-2025-54769
 An authenticated, read-only user can upload a file and perform a directory traversal to have the uploaded file placed in a location of their choosing.  This can be used to overwrite existing PERL modules within the application to achieve remote code execution (RCE) by an attacker.

## CVE-2025-50777
 The firmware of the AZIOT 2MP Full HD Smart Wi-Fi CCTV Home Security Camera (version V1.00.02) contains an Incorrect Access Control vulnerability that allows local attackers to gain root shell access. Once accessed, the device exposes critical data including Wi-Fi credentials and ONVIF service credentials stored in plaintext, enabling further compromise of the network and connected systems.

## CVE-2025-6018
 A Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) vulnerability has been discovered in pam-config within Linux Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM). This flaw allows an unprivileged local attacker (for example, a user logged in via SSH) to obtain the elevated privileges normally reserved for a physically present, "allow_active" user. The highest risk is that the attacker can then perform all allow_active yes Polkit actions, which are typically restricted to console users, potentially gaining unauthorized control over system configurations, services, or other sensitive operations.

## CVE-2025-1219
 In PHP from 8.1.* before 8.1.32, from 8.2.* before 8.2.28, from 8.3.* before 8.3.19, from 8.4.* before 8.4.5, when requesting a HTTP resource using the DOM or SimpleXML extensions, the wrong content-type header is used to determine the charset when the requested resource performs a redirect. This may cause the resulting document to be parsed incorrectly or bypass validations.

## CVE-2024-3432
 A vulnerability was found in PuneethReddyHC Event Management 1.0. It has been rated as critical. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /backend/register.php. The manipulation of the argument event_id/full_name/email/mobile/college/branch leads to sql injection. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier VDB-259613 was assigned to this vulnerability. NOTE: The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.

## CVE-2023-22809
 In Sudo before 1.9.12p2, the sudoedit (aka -e) feature mishandles extra arguments passed in the user-provided environment variables (SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR), allowing a local attacker to append arbitrary entries to the list of files to process. This can lead to privilege escalation. Affected versions are 1.8.0 through 1.9.12.p1. The problem exists because a user-specified editor may contain a "--" argument that defeats a protection mechanism, e.g., an EDITOR='vim -- /path/to/extra/file' value.

## CVE-2023-22493
 RSSHub is an open source RSS feed generator. RSSHub is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to send arbitrary HTTP requests from the server to other servers or resources on the network. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a request to the affected routes with a malicious URL. An attacker could also use this vulnerability to send requests to internal or any other servers or resources on the network, potentially gain access to sensitive information that would not normally be accessible and amplifying the impact of the attack. The patch for this issue can be found in commit a66cbcf.

## CVE-2021-41773
 A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.
