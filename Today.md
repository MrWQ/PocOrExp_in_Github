## CVE-2025-4403
 The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.6 due to accepting a user‐supplied supported_type string and the uploaded filename without enforcing real extension or MIME checks within the upload() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

## CVE-2024-36991
 In Splunk Enterprise on Windows versions below 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10, an attacker could perform a path traversal on the /modules/messaging/ endpoint in Splunk Enterprise on Windows. This vulnerability should only affect Splunk Enterprise on Windows.

## CVE-2024-4577
 In PHP versions 8.1.* before 8.1.29, 8.2.* before 8.2.20, 8.3.* before 8.3.8, when using Apache and PHP-CGI on Windows, if the system is set up to use certain code pages, Windows may use "Best-Fit" behavior to replace characters in command line given to Win32 API functions. PHP CGI module may misinterpret those characters as PHP options, which may allow a malicious user to pass options to PHP binary being run, and thus reveal the source code of scripts, run arbitrary PHP code on the server, etc.

## CVE-2023-45131
 Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. New chat messages can be read by making an unauthenticated POST request to MessageBus. This issue is patched in the 3.1.1 stable and 3.2.0.beta2 versions of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

## CVE-2023-37467
 Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.1.0.beta7 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, a CSP (Content Security Policy) nonce reuse vulnerability was discovered could allow cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks to bypass CSP protection for anonymous (i.e. unauthenticated) users. There are no known XSS vectors at the moment, but should one be discovered, this vulnerability would allow the XSS attack to bypass CSP and execute successfully. This vulnerability isn't applicable to logged-in users. Version 3.1.0.beta7 contains a patch. The stable branch doesn't have this vulnerability. A workaround to prevent the vulnerability is to disable Google Tag Manager, i.e., unset the `gtm container id` setting.

## CVE-2021-41773
 A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.

## CVE-2021-25646
 Apache Druid includes the ability to execute user-provided JavaScript code embedded in various types of requests. This functionality is intended for use in high-trust environments, and is disabled by default. However, in Druid 0.20.0 and earlier, it is possible for an authenticated user to send a specially-crafted request that forces Druid to run user-provided JavaScript code for that request, regardless of server configuration. This can be leveraged to execute code on the target machine with the privileges of the Druid server process.
